1.What are the two values of the Boolean data type? How do you write them?
True
False
2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?
AND
OR
NOT

3. Make a list of each Boolean operator's truth tables (i.e. every possible combination of Boolean values for the operator and what it evaluate ).
a , b 
AND : True if both are true otherwise False eg. a and b 
OR  : True for at least one case is True eg. a or b
NOT : True only if incorrect or False eg.not b
4. What are the values of the following expressions?
(5 > 4) and (3 == 5)
False
not (5 > 4)
False
(5 > 4) or (3 == 5)
True
not ((5 > 4) or (3 == 5))
False
(True and True) and (True == False)
False
(not False) or (not True)
True
5. What are the six comparison operators?
Equal to
Not equal to
greater than
greater than or equal to
less than
less than or equal to


6. How do you tell the difference between the equal to and assignment operators?Describe a condition and when you would use one.
'=' is assignment operator. eg a = 10 then after giving a input I will get 10 as output.
'==' is equal to operator eg. 3 == 5 then it will give output in true or False(boolean)


7. Identify the three blocks in this code:
Block1:
spam = 0
if spam == 10:
print('eggs')

Block2
if spam > 5:
print('bacon')
else:
print('ham')

Block3
print('spam')
print('spam')


8. Write code that prints Hello if 1 is stored in spam, prints Howdy if 2 is stored in spam, and prints Greetings! if anything else is stored in spam.
spam = int(input("Enter the no.1 or 2 or anything"))
if spam == 1:
    print("Hello")
elif spam == 2:
    print("Howdy")
else:
    print("Greetings!")

9.If your programme is stuck in an endless loop, what keys youâ€™ll press?
ctrl + c
10. How can you tell the difference between break and continue?
continue skips current iteration & passes to next interation. 
break will stop the loop & pass to next loop 


11. In a for loop, what is the difference between range(10), range(0, 10), and range(0, 10, 1)?
range(10): will print 0 to 9, will exclude last element, user can give only one argument(n) (stop) as input & will get output values starting from 0 to n-1
range(0,10):will print 0 to 9, will exclude last element,  user can give two arguments(a,b)(Start, stop) as input & will get output values starting from a to b-1
range(0, 10, 1):will print 0 to 9, will exclude last element, user can give three argument(a,b,c) (Start, stop, step) as input & will get values starting from a to b-1 with a step size of c


12. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop. Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop.
For loop
for i in range(1,11):
    print(i)
    
While loop
i = 0
while i < 10:
    i +=1
    print(i)
    
13. If you had a function named bacon() inside a module named spam, how would you call it after importing spam?
spam.bacon()
