1. What exactly is []?
Its an empty list. Collection of values separated by comma it cam have.

2. In a list of values stored in a variable called spam, how would you assign the value 'hello' as the third value? (Assume [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] are in spam.)
spam[2] = 'hello'
print(spam)

Let's pretend the spam includes the list ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] for the next three queries.
3. What is the value of spam[int(int('3' * 2) / 11)]?
3

4. What is the value of spam[-1]?
d

5. What is the value of spam[:2]?
['a','b']

Let's pretend bacon has the list [3.14, 'cat,' 11, 'cat,' True] for the next three questions.
6. What is the value of bacon.index('cat')?
1

7. How does bacon.append(99) change the look of the list value in bacon?
[3.14, 'cat', 11, 'cat', True, 99]

8. How does bacon.remove('cat') change the look of the list in bacon?
[3.14, 11, 'cat', True, 99]

9. What are the list concatenation and list replication operators?
Cocatenation is addition of 2 lists & replication is repeting of list multiple times

10. What is difference between the list methods append() and insert()?
append will add the element in the list to last index by taking 1 argument & insert will take 2 arguments 
it will add the element to list with the desired index & other elemnts index will be increased by 1.

11. What are the two methods for removing items from a list?
list_name.remove()-this will remove desired element to specify
listn_name.pop()-this will remove last element in list

12. Describe how list values and string values are identical.
Background datastructure is array. Both follow sequences. Both work on indexing.

13. What's the difference between tuples and lists?
Tuples are immutable,can be described with (), having less memory than list
lists are mutable,can be described with [], requires more memory than tuple

14. How do you type a tuple value that only contains the integer 42?
t = (42,)

15. How do you get a list value's tuple form? How do you get a tuple value's list form?
List comprehension along with zip() function

16. Variables that "contain" list values are not necessarily lists themselves. Instead, what do they contain?
it will contain references to list values

17. How do you distinguish between copy.copy() and copy.deepcopy()?
copy.copy() - changes original object if changes done later
copy.deepcopy()- will not change original object if it will change later. It will create new object
